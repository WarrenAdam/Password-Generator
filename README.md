# Password-Generator

## Description
This week's challenge is to use starter code to create a functioning password generator. To implent this password generator, we used our knowledge of JavaScript to make the starter code function. Within this password generator, we used conditional statements, functions, methods, if statements, for-loops and more to ensure that the password generator randomized and genrated specific passwords. In addition, the password generator contains alerts if an undesired action was input from the user. This alert would then redirect them to try again with a guiding prompt. For the challenge to be successful, the user will be able to generate a password randomly based on the prompts created by the developer without any issues.

## User Story
The following is reasoning to make the password generator (adapted from bootcamp module 3 challenge):

AS AN employee with access to sensitive data
I WANT to randomly generate a password that meets certain criteria
SO THAT I can create a strong password that provides greater security

## Acceptance Criteria
The following is the requirements needed to make the password generator successful (adapted from bootcamp module 3 challenge):

GIVEN I need a new, secure password
WHEN I click the button to generate a password
THEN I am presented with a series of prompts for password criteria
WHEN prompted for password criteria
THEN I select which criteria to include in the password
WHEN prompted for the length of the password
THEN I choose a length of at least 8 characters and no more than 128 characters
WHEN asked for character types to include in the password
THEN I confirm whether or not to include lowercase, uppercase, numeric, and/or special characters
WHEN I answer each prompt
THEN my input should be validated and at least one character type should be selected
WHEN all prompts are answered
THEN a password is generated that matches the selected criteria
WHEN the password is generated
THEN the password is either displayed in an alert or written to the page
